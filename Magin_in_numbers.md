# üß† Why Don't Integers Support `Infinity` or `NaN`?

## ‚úÖ 1. Integer Type System is Discrete
- Integers are whole numbers: `... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...`
- There are no values *between* integers and no representation of overflow or division errors like `‚àû` or `NaN`.

In contrast:
- Floating-point types (`float`, `double`) follow **IEEE 754**, which defines representations for:
  - `+‚àû`, `-‚àû`
  - `NaN` (Not a Number)
  - Subnormal numbers
  - `-0`, `+0`

## ‚úÖ 2. Overflow/Divide-by-Zero in Integers = Logical Error
- For integers, division by zero isn't mathematically meaningful.
- Allowing something like `int.Infinity` would cause **undefined behavior** in integer algorithms (e.g., in loops, indexes, etc.).

## ‚úÖ 3. Performance and Simplicity
- Integers are used in **low-level**, **high-performance**, and **bitwise operations**.
- Supporting `Infinity` or `NaN` would mean every integer would need **extra metadata**, making it slower and larger in memory.

So C# and .NET designers opted to **throw an exception** instead ‚Äî it's a clearer and safer design for the developer.

# üîß Tips for Dealing with Floats

- Use `float.IsInfinity(x)` and `float.IsNaN(x)` to check before using.
- Don‚Äôt compare floats directly. Use a tolerance:
```csharp
if (Math.Abs(a - b) < 0.0001f) { /* Equal */ }
```

# üß† Why float can't be compared directly with double

When you compare a float with a double in C#, you‚Äôre comparing two values with different precisions (levels of accuracy). Here's why this matters:

## ‚úÖ 1. Different Sizes

| Type     | Size    | Approx. Precision      | Range                           |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `float`  | 32 bits | \~6‚Äì7 decimal digits   | ¬±1.5 √ó 10^‚àí45 to ¬±3.4 √ó 10^38   |
| `double` | 64 bits | \~15‚Äì17 decimal digits | ¬±5.0 √ó 10^‚àí324 to ¬±1.7 √ó 10^308 |

A float cannot represent values as precisely as a double. When a float is implicitly or explicitly cast to a double, the value gets promoted ‚Äî but the precision doesn't magically improve. The imprecision that existed in the original float is still there

## Example

```csharp
float f = 0.1f;
double d = 0.1;

Console.WriteLine(f == d); // False
```

Why is this false?
- f is 0.10000000149011612 (what float can represent).

- d is 0.1 exactly in double.

- Even though they look the same when printed, the actual bits are different. So, f == d is false.

‚ö†Ô∏è When comparing float and double:
- Avoid direct equality.

- Use an epsilon-based comparison:

```csharp
float f = 0.1f;
double d = 0.1;

bool areEqual = Math.Abs(f - d) < 1e-6; // tolerance
```
üí° TL;DR

- float has less precision than double.

- Comparing float with double leads to false negatives because of binary rounding differences.

- Always use a tolerance-based comparison if you must compare them.
